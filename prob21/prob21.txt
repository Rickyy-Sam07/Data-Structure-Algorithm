Step-by-Step Breakdown
Initialization:

res is an empty list that will eventually store the final result.
x is an intermediate list that will store the zigzagged rows.
Loop through the rows:

The loop iterates through each row in the grid (the grid is a 2D list).
Reversing odd-indexed rows:

For each row where the index i is odd (i.e., the second, fourth, sixth rows, etc.), we reverse the row using slicing ([::-1]).
The extend() method is used to append the entire reversed row to the list x.
Keeping even-indexed rows unchanged:

For rows where the index i is even (i.e., the first, third, fifth rows, etc.), we append the row to the list x as is.
Selecting every second element:

Once all rows are processed and stored in x, we select every second element using slicing (x[::2]). This creates the final list res.
Example 1:
Input:
python
Copy code
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
Step-by-step execution:
First row (index 0, even): [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)

x = [1, 2, 3]
Second row (index 1, odd): [4, 5, 6] (reversed)

Reversed: [6, 5, 4]
x = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]
Third row (index 2, even): [7, 8, 9] (unchanged)

x = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9]
Select every second element:

x[::2] = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Output:
python
Copy code
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Example 2:
Input:
python
Copy code
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    [10, 11, 12]
]
Step-by-step execution:
First row (index 0, even): [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)

x = [1, 2, 3]
Second row (index 1, odd): [4, 5, 6] (reversed)

Reversed: [6, 5, 4]
x = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4]
Third row (index 2, even): [7, 8, 9] (unchanged)

x = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9]
Fourth row (index 3, odd): [10, 11, 12] (reversed)

Reversed: [12, 11, 10]
x = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 11, 10]
Select every second element:

x[::2] = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Output:
python
Copy code
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Explanation of Key Concepts:
grid[i][::-1]:

This slices the row at index i and reverses it. The [::-1] syntax creates a reversed copy of the list.
x.extend():

This method appends each element of the argument (the row) to the list x. If the row is reversed, it adds the reversed elements to x.
x[::2]:

This slices the list x to return every second element, starting from the first element (index 0).
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity:
O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. We loop through all the elements in the grid once, then perform an operation (slicing, reversing, or extending) on each row.
Space Complexity:
O(m * n), because we create a list x that stores all elements from the grid.
