Example Walkthrough:
Input:
python
Copy code
times = [[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 6]], targetFriend = 1
Step 1: target_time = [2, 3] (since targetFriend = 1).

Step 2: Sort times: After sorting, times = [[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 6]]. (In this case, the list is already sorted.)

Step 3: Initialize chair_time = [0, 0, 0] to represent the availability of each chair.

Processing Friends:

Friend 0 arrives at time 1 and leaves at time 4.
We find that chair 0 is available (chair_time[0] = 0).
Friend 0 sits in chair 0, and chair_time[0] = 4 (chair 0 becomes free at time 4).
Friend 1 (target friend) arrives at time 2 and leaves at time 3.
We find that chair 1 is available (chair_time[1] = 0).
Friend 1 (target friend) sits in chair 1, and chair_time[1] = 3 (chair 1 becomes free at time 3).
Since time == target_time, we return chair 1.

Output: 1




Code Explanation
Input:
times: A list of lists where each sublist contains the arrival and leaving times of a friend, e.g., times = [[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 6]].
targetFriend: The index of the friend for whom we need to find the chair, e.g., targetFriend = 1.
Step-by-Step Breakdown:
python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def smallestChair(self, times: List[List[int]], targetFriend: int) -> int:
        target_time = times[targetFriend]
Goal: The goal is to find out which chair the targetFriend will sit on.
target_time: We extract the arrival and leaving times of the targetFriend from the times list. For example, if targetFriend = 1, then target_time will be [2, 3].
python
Copy code
        times.sort()
Sorting by Arrival Time: The times list is sorted. This will order the friends by their arrival times. Sorting ensures we process friends in the order they arrive at the party. Since times consists of pairs [arrival, leaving], sorting will sort primarily by arrival.
python
Copy code
        n = len(times)
        chair_time = [0] * n
n: The number of friends, which is the length of the times list.
chair_time: A list that tracks the time each chair becomes free. Initially, all chairs are available (indicated by 0). The index of chair_time corresponds to the chair number. For example, chair_time[0] tracks when chair 0 becomes free.

        for time in times:
We loop through each friend's arrival and leaving time after sorting. time here represents each friend’s [arrival, leaving].

            for i in range(n):
                if chair_time[i] <= time[0]:
Inner Loop (chair allocation): For each friend, we check every chair (from chair 0 to chair n-1), trying to find an available chair.
Condition: chair_time[i] <= time[0] checks if chair i is free by the time the current friend arrives. If the chair is available, the friend can sit on it.
chair_time[i] represents the time when chair i becomes available after the previous occupant leaves. If chair_time[i] is less than or equal to time[0] (the arrival time of the current friend), it means the chair is free.


                    chair_time[i] = time[1]
Assign Chair: Once an available chair is found, we assign it to the friend. We update chair_time[i] to time[1], meaning the chair will become available again at the friend's leaving time.


                    if time == target_time:
                        return i
Check for Target Friend: If the current friend’s time matches the target_time of the targetFriend, we return the chair number (i). This is because we’ve found the chair the target friend is sitting on.

                    break
Exit the Inner Loop: After assigning a chair to the friend, we break out of the inner loop and move on to the next friend.

        return 0
This is a fallback return statement, but it should never be reached in this logic since the target friend is guaranteed to be in the list.
