Goal of the Code:
The goal of this code is to evaluate a boolean expression that consists of t (true), f (false), and logical operators like ! (NOT), & (AND), and | (OR). The expression may contain parentheses that group these operators and values together, so we process each part step by step using a stack.

Key Concept:
We are using a stack to keep track of everything—values (True, False), operators (!, &, |), and parentheses. We process the expression character by character, and when we see a ) (closing parenthesis), we evaluate the sub-expression inside the parentheses.

Breaking Down the Code:
Class Definition and Function Initialization:



class Solution:
    def parseBoolExpr(self, expression: str) -> bool:


class Solution: defines a class called Solution.
def parseBoolExpr(self, expression: str) -> bool: defines a function inside that class. It takes a string expression as input and returns True or False.
Initialize an Empty Stack:


    stack = []


We create an empty stack using a list. This will help us keep track of the operators and values (True or False) as we process the expression.
Loop Through Each Character of the Expression:


    for char in expression:


This loop goes through each character of the input expression one by one. char will represent the current character.
Process 't' (True) and 'f' (False):

python
Copy code
        if char == 't':
            stack.append(True)
        elif char == 'f':
            stack.append(False)


If the character is 't', it means True. So, we push True onto the stack.
If the character is 'f', it means False. So, we push False onto the stack.
Process Operators (!, &, |):

python
Copy code
        elif char in ('!', '&', '|'):
            stack.append(char)


If the character is an operator (!, &, or |), we push it onto the stack. These operators will be applied later when we encounter a closing parenthesis ).
Evaluate When We Encounter a Closing Parenthesis ):

python
Copy code
        elif char == ')':


A closing parenthesis means we've reached the end of a sub-expression. Now, we need to evaluate the part inside the parentheses.
Extract the Sub-Expression Inside the Parentheses:

python
Copy code
            sub_expr = []
            while stack[-1] != '(':
                sub_expr.append(stack.pop())
            stack.pop()  # Remove the '('


We create a list sub_expr to collect all the values and operators inside the parentheses.
We pop elements from the stack until we find an opening parenthesis '('. All the popped elements are added to sub_expr.
After we've collected everything inside the parentheses, we pop and discard the '('.
Get the Operator and Apply It:


            operator = stack.pop()


Now, we pop the operator (!, &, or |) from the stack. This operator will be applied to the values in sub_expr.
Apply the Operator:

For ! (NOT):

          if operator == '!':
              stack.append(not sub_expr[0])


The NOT operator works on only one value. So, we negate the first (and only) value in sub_expr. If it’s True, it becomes False, and if it’s False, it becomes True.
We then push the result back onto the stack.
For & (AND):


          elif operator == '&':
              stack.append(all(sub_expr))



The AND operator (&) returns True if all the values in sub_expr are True. Otherwise, it returns False.
We use Python’s all() function to check if all values are True.
We push the result (either True or False) back onto the stack.
For | (OR):


          elif operator == '|':
              stack.append(any(sub_expr))



The OR operator (|) returns True if any of the values in sub_expr is True. If all are False, it returns False.
We use Python’s any() function to check if at least one value is True.
We push the result (either True or False) back onto the stack.
Process Opening Parenthesis (:


       elif char == '(':
           stack.append('(')


If we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', we simply push it onto the stack. This marks the start of a sub-expression.
Return the Final Result:


   return stack[0]

After processing the entire expression, the stack will contain just one value—the final result (True or False).
We return that value as the result of the boolean expression.
Example Walkthrough:
Let's take an example expression: "!(&(t,f))"

The characters are processed one by one:

'!': push ! onto the stack → stack = ['!']
'(': push ( onto the stack → stack = ['!', '(']
'&': push & onto the stack → stack = ['!', '(', '&']
'(': push ( onto the stack → stack = ['!', '(', '&', '(']
't': push True onto the stack → stack = ['!', '(', '&', '(', True]
',': skip (ignore commas)
'f': push False onto the stack → stack = ['!', '(', '&', '(', True, False]
')': pop and evaluate → stack = ['!', '(', '&', True, False], evaluate AND → result is False, push False onto the stack → stack = ['!', '(', False]
')': pop and evaluate → stack = ['!', False], evaluate NOT → result is True, push True onto the stack → stack = [True]
The final result is True.
