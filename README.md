## üìù Introduction
This repository serves as a go-to resource for anyone looking to practice **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews or just aiming to improve your coding skills, you'll find valuable DSA problem sets and algorithms in **C** and **Python**.

### Key Features:
- Problems with **clear explanations**.
- Solutions provided in both **C** and **Python**.
- Well-commented code for easier understanding.
- Focused on commonly asked **DSA problems** from coding interviews and competitive programming.

```

## üåê Language Support
All problems and algorithms are implemented in:
- **C**
- **Python**

For every problem, you will find:
1. A Markdown file (`.md`) explaining the problem statement, input/output format, and approach.
2. A **C implementation** file (`.c`).
3. A **Python implementation** file (`.py`).

## üõ† How to Use the Repository
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rickyy-Sam07/DSA.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific problem or algorithm folder.
3. Read the problem statement (`.md` file) and understand the solution approach.
4. Check out the **C** or **Python** code for the solution.
5. Run the code on your local environment:
   - For **C**:
     ```bash
     gcc problem_name.c -o problem_name
     ./problem_name
     ```
   - For **Python**:
     ```bash
     python3 problem_name.py
     ```

## üìö List of Topics Covered
The following topics are covered in this repository:

1. **Arrays**
   - Common problems like **Two Sum**, **Maximum Subarray**, etc.
2. **Linked Lists**
   - Reversing a linked list, detecting cycles, etc.
3. **Stacks and Queues**
   - Implementing stacks/queues, balancing parentheses, etc.
4. **Trees**
   - Binary search tree operations, tree traversals, etc.
5. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
6. **Searching Algorithms**
   - Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
7. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence, etc.
