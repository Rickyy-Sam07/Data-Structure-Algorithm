so basically here we are using a concep  of diagonal costructor method which says as follows :

Diagonal Construction Method
The idea is to construct a binary string by choosing the opposite bit of the i-th character of the i-th string. 
This guarantees that the generated string will differ from every input string at least in one position.

Algorithm Steps:
Initialize an empty result string.
Iterate through each string in nums using the index i.
For each index i, if the i-th character of nums[i] is '0', add '1' to the result string, and vice-versa.
Return the constructed string.
