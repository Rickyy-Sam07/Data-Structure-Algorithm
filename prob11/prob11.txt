1. Importing the combinations function:

from itertools import combinations
This imports the combinations function from Python's itertools library. The combinations function allows you to generate all possible combinations (subsets) of a given size from an array. For example, for an array nums = [3, 1], combinations(nums, 1) generates [3], [1], and combinations(nums, 2) generates [3, 1].
2. Function Definition: countMaxOrSubsets(nums):
The function is designed to calculate the maximum possible bitwise OR of all non-empty subsets of the given array nums and then count how many subsets achieve that maximum OR.

Step 1: Initial Setup

n = len(nums)  # Get the length of the nums array
max_or = 0     # Initialize max_or to 0, which will store the maximum OR value
subsets = []   # This list will store all non-empty subsets
n holds the number of elements in the input array nums.
max_or is initialized to 0. It will store the maximum bitwise OR value found during the computation.
subsets is initialized as an empty list, which will later store all the possible non-empty subsets of nums.
Step 2: Generate All Non-Empty Subsets

for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Iterate through subset sizes (from 1 to n)
    for subset in combinations(nums, i):  # Generate all combinations of size i
        subsets.append(subset)  # Add each subset to the list
This loop generates all possible subsets of nums using the combinations function.
range(1, n+1) ensures that you get subsets of size 1 to n. For each size i, the inner loop generates all combinations (subsets) of that size.
The subsets are then stored in the subsets list.
Step 3: Find the Maximum OR Value

for subset in subsets:
    current_or = 0  # Initialize the OR result for the current subset
    for num in subset:
        current_or |= num  # Perform the bitwise OR for the current subset
    max_or = max(max_or, current_or)  # Update the max_or if current_or is higher
This loop calculates the bitwise OR for each subset.
current_or starts at 0 for each subset, and the loop applies the |= (bitwise OR) operation to accumulate the OR result for all elements in the subset.
After computing the OR of the current subset, the maximum OR (max_or) is updated if the current OR is greater than the previously recorded maximum OR.
Step 4: Count Subsets that Achieve the Maximum OR

count = 0  # Initialize a count variable
for subset in subsets:
    current_or = 0  # Initialize the OR result for the current subset
    for num in subset:
        current_or |= num  # Perform the bitwise OR for the current subset
    if current_or == max_or:  # If the OR matches the maximum OR, increase count
        count += 1
After determining the maximum OR, this loop counts how many subsets give this maximum OR value.
For each subset, the OR is recalculated. If the OR of the subset equals the max_or, the count is incremented.
Step 5: Return the Count

return count  # Return the number of subsets with the maximum OR
Finally, the function returns the number of subsets that have the maximum OR.
Example Usage:

print(countMaxOrSubsets([3, 1]))    # Output: 2
print(countMaxOrSubsets([2, 2, 2])) # Output: 7
print(countMaxOrSubsets([3, 2, 1, 5])) # Output: 6
Explanation of Outputs:
For nums = [3, 1]:

The maximum OR is 3.
Subsets that give the maximum OR are [3] and [3, 1].
So, the output is 2.
For nums = [2, 2, 2]:

All non-empty subsets give an OR of 2.
There are 
2
3
−
1
=
7
2 
3
 −1=7 non-empty subsets.
So, the output is 7.
For nums = [3, 2, 1, 5]:

The maximum OR is 7.
Subsets that give the maximum OR are [3, 5], [3, 2, 5], [3, 1, 5], [2, 5], [2, 1, 5], and [3, 2, 1, 5].
So, the output is 6.
Summary:
The function first generates all possible non-empty subsets of nums.
It then calculates the maximum bitwise OR of any subset.
Finally, it counts how many subsets achieve that maximum OR.



///bitwise OR ex.////
Example Walkthrough with nums = [3, 2, 1, 5]:
Subsets: The non-empty subsets of [3, 2, 1, 5] are:

[3], [2], [1], [5], [3, 2], [3, 1], [3, 5], [2, 1], [2, 5], [1, 5], [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 5], [3, 1, 5], [2, 1, 5], [3, 2, 1, 5]
Bitwise OR for each subset:

OR of [3] → 3
OR of [2] → 2
OR of [1] → 1
OR of [5] → 5
OR of [3, 2] → 3 | 2 = 3
OR of [3, 1] → 3 | 1 = 3
OR of [3, 5] → 3 | 5 = 7
OR of [2, 1] → 2 | 1 = 3
OR of [2, 5] → 2 | 5 = 7
OR of [1, 5] → 1 | 5 = 5
OR of [3, 2, 1] → 3 | 2 | 1 = 3
OR of [3, 2, 5] → 3 | 2 | 5 = 7
OR of [3, 1, 5] → 3 | 1 | 5 = 7
OR of [2, 1, 5] → 2 | 1 | 5 = 7
OR of [3, 2, 1, 5] → 3 | 2 | 1 | 5 = 7
Maximum OR: The maximum OR is 7.

Counting Subsets with Maximum OR: The subsets that give an OR of 7 are:

[3, 5], [3, 2, 5], [3, 1, 5], [2, 5], [2, 1, 5], [3, 2, 1, 5]
So, there are 6 subsets with the maximum OR.

Thus, the output for nums = [3, 2, 1, 5] is 6.




>>>>Example Walkthrough:
Let’s walk through an example with nums = [3, 1].

Subsets: The non-empty subsets of [3, 1] are:

[3]
[1]
[3, 1]
Bitwise OR for each subset:

OR of [3] → 3 (binary 11)
OR of [1] → 1 (binary 01)
OR of [3, 1] → 3 | 1 = 3 (binary 11)
Maximum OR: The maximum OR is 3.

Count subsets with maximum OR: The subsets that give an OR of 3 are:

[3]
[3, 1] So, there are 2 subsets with the maximum OR.
Thus, the output for nums = [3, 1] is 2.
