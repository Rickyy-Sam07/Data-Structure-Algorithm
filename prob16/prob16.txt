1. Class and Method Definition
python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def isCircularSentence(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
Class: Solution is defined as a class, which can contain methods related to solving problems.
Method: isCircularSentence is a method that takes a single argument sentence, which is expected to be a string. It returns a boolean value (True or False).
2. Splitting the Sentence into Words
python
Copy code
words = sentence.split()
The split() method divides the sentence into a list of words based on whitespace.
Example: For the input sentence = "banana apple", the result would be words = ['banana', 'apple'].
3. Calculating the Number of Words
python
Copy code
n = len(words)
The len() function returns the number of elements in the words list.
Example: If words = ['banana', 'apple'], then n would be 2.
4. Checking Edge Cases
python
Copy code
if n == 0:
    return False
elif n == 1:
    return words[0][0] == words[0][-1]
Empty Sentence Check: If n is 0, it means there are no words, so the function returns False.
Single Word Check: If n is 1, it checks if the first letter is the same as the last letter of the single word (words[0][0] == words[0][-1]). If they match, it returns True, otherwise False.
5. Looping Through Words to Check the Circular Condition
python
Copy code
for i in range(n):
    if words[i][-1] != words[(i + 1) % n][0]:
        return False
Looping: The loop iterates through each word in the list using the variable i, which represents the index of the current word.
Circular Comparison: The key formula here is words[(i + 1) % n][0]:
words[i][-1] accesses the last character of the current word.
words[(i + 1) % n][0] accesses the first character of the next word.
The expression (i + 1) % n ensures that when i reaches the last index, it wraps around to 0, creating a circular effect.
Example:
For words = ['banana', 'apple']:
For i = 0: Check if words[0][-1] (last letter of "banana", which is a) is equal to words[1][0] (first letter of "apple", which is also a).
For i = 1: Check if words[1][-1] (last letter of "apple", which is e) is equal to words[0][0] (first letter of "banana", which is b).
If any comparison fails, it returns False.
6. Final Return Statement
python
Copy code
return True
If all checks pass and the loop completes without returning False, the function returns True, indicating that the sentence is circular.
Formula Explanation
Indexing:
words[i][-1]: This accesses the last character of the word at index i.
words[(i + 1) % n][0]:
(i + 1) % n: This calculates the next index while ensuring it wraps around to the beginning if i is the last index.
[0]: This accesses the first character of the word at the calculated index.
Example Walkthrough
Let's see how this function works with a specific example:

Input
python
Copy code
sentence = "banana apple"
Execution
Splitting:

words = ['banana', 'apple']
n = 2
Edge Case Check:

n is not 0 and n is not 1, so it proceeds to the loop.
Loop:

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
Check: Is words[0][-1] (a) equal to words[1][0] (a)? Yes, so continue.
Iteration 2 (i = 1):
Check: Is words[1][-1] (e) equal to words[0][0] (b)? No, so return False.
Final Output: False

Example of a Circular Sentence
Input
python
Copy code
sentence = "apple elephant"
Execution
Splitting:

words = ['apple', 'elephant']
n = 2
Edge Case Check: Proceed to loop.

Loop:

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
Check: Is words[0][-1] (e) equal to words[1][0] (e)? Yes, so continue.
Iteration 2 (i = 1):
Check: Is words[1][-1] (t) equal to words[0][0] (a)? No, return False.
Final Output: False
