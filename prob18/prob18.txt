Example: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaabb"
Let's apply this example to the code.

comp = ""

Initialize an empty string comp to store the result.
This will eventually hold the compressed version of the input word.
i = 0

Initialize i, a pointer, to iterate through each character of the word. We start at index 0.
while i < len(word):

This while loop continues as long as i is within the bounds of word.
First Iteration
At i = 0, the character is 'a'.
char = word[i]

Assign char as the current character (word[0] = 'a').
char is now 'a', which weâ€™ll be counting in the next step.
count = 0

Initialize count to 0 to count consecutive occurrences of char (here, 'a').
while i < len(word) and word[i] == char and count < 9:

This inner while loop counts how many times the character 'a' appears consecutively, limited to a maximum of 9.

For each iteration, count increases by 1, and i advances by 1.

After nine iterations (from i = 0 to i = 9), count reaches 9, and i becomes 9. The loop stops since count < 9 condition fails.

comp += f"{count}{char}"

Append f"{count}{char}" to comp, which is "9a" after this step.
Now, comp becomes "9a".
Second Iteration
The outer while loop repeats since i = 9, which is still less than len(word).
char = word[i]

char is set to the current character (word[9] = 'a').
count = 0

count is reset to 0 for counting this new set of 'a' characters.
while i < len(word) and word[i] == char and count < 9:

The inner while loop counts up to 9 consecutive occurrences of 'a'.
Here, only 5 'a' characters are left (i = 9 to i = 14), so count becomes 5 and i becomes 14.
comp += f"{count}{char}"

Append f"{count}{char}" to comp, resulting in "5a".
Now, comp becomes "9a5a".
Third Iteration
The outer while loop continues since i = 14.
char = word[i]

char is set to the current character (word[14] = 'b').
count = 0

count is reset to 0 to count this new character 'b'.
while i < len(word) and word[i] == char and count < 9:

The inner while loop counts up to 9 consecutive occurrences of 'b'.
Here, only 2 'b' characters are left (i = 14 to i = 16), so count becomes 2 and i becomes 16.
comp += f"{count}{char}"

Append f"{count}{char}" to comp, resulting in "2b".
Now, comp becomes "9a5a2b".
return comp

The while loop ends because i is now 16, which is equal to len(word).
Return comp, which is "9a5a2b".
Final Output
The final compressed string for "aaaaaaaaaaaaaabb" is "9a5a2b"
