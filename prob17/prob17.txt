Code Explanation
python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def rotateString(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
We define a method rotateString within the Solution class, which takes two parameters: s (the original string) and goal (the target string we want to check for rotation).
Step 1: Length Check
python
Copy code
        # Check if the lengths are different; if so, rotation is impossible
        if len(s) != len(goal):
            return False
Purpose: If the lengths of s and goal are different, goal cannot be a rotation of s. For example, a rotation of "abc" would always have to be 3 characters long. So if s and goal have different lengths, we immediately return False.

Example:

If s = "abcde" and goal = "cdeab", both strings have a length of 5, so we proceed.
If s = "abc" and goal = "abcd", they have different lengths, so the function will return False here.
Step 2: Concatenate s with Itself
python
Copy code
        # Concatenate s with itself
        out = s + s
Purpose: Concatenating s with itself (i.e., s + s) creates a new string that contains all possible rotations of s as substrings.

How It Works:

When you double the string, any rotation of s will appear as a substring within this doubled string.
For example, if s = "abcde", then s + s = "abcdeabcde". This contains every possible rotation of s:
"abcde" (the original string)
"bcdea"
"cdeab"
"deabc"
"eabcd"
Example:

If s = "abcde", then out = "abcdeabcde".
Step 3: Check if goal is a Substring of out
python
Copy code
        # Check if goal is a substring of the concatenated string
        if goal in out:
            return True
        else:
            return False
Purpose: This line checks if goal is a substring within out (i.e., within s + s). If goal is a substring of out, then goal is a valid rotation of s, and we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

Example:

Example 1:
If s = "abcde" and goal = "cdeab", then out = "abcdeabcde".
We check if "cdeab" is in "abcdeabcde", which it is. So, the function returns True.
Example 2:
If s = "abcde" and goal = "abced", then out = "abcdeabcde".
We check if "abced" is in "abcdeabcde", which it is not. So, the function returns False.
