Function Explanation:
The function computes the prefix common array for two input arrays A and B.

Key Data Structures:

seen_A and seen_B: Sets that keep track of elements encountered so far in A and B, respectively.
common: A set that stores elements found in both seen_A and seen_B (i.e., common elements up to the current index).
Result:

At every index i, the function appends the size of the common set (i.e., the count of numbers common in A and B up to index i) to the result list.
Example 1: A = [1, 3, 2, 4], B = [3, 1, 2, 4]
Initialization:

seen_A = set()
seen_B = set()
common = set()
result = []
Iteration Steps:

Index i = 0:

Add A[0] = 1 to seen_A: seen_A = {1}.
Add B[0] = 3 to seen_B: seen_B = {3}.
A[0] = 1 is not in seen_B.
B[0] = 3 is not in seen_A.
common = {} (no common elements yet).
Append len(common) = 0 to result: result = [0].
Index i = 1:

Add A[1] = 3 to seen_A: seen_A = {1, 3}.
Add B[1] = 1 to seen_B: seen_B = {1, 3}.
A[1] = 3 is in seen_B, so add 3 to common.
B[1] = 1 is in seen_A, so add 1 to common.
common = {1, 3}.
Append len(common) = 2 to result: result = [0, 2].
Index i = 2:

Add A[2] = 2 to seen_A: seen_A = {1, 2, 3}.
Add B[2] = 2 to seen_B: seen_B = {1, 2, 3}.
A[2] = 2 is in seen_B, so add 2 to common.
B[2] = 2 is in seen_A (already added to common).
common = {1, 2, 3}.
Append len(common) = 3 to result: result = [0, 2, 3].
Index i = 3:

Add A[3] = 4 to seen_A: seen_A = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Add B[3] = 4 to seen_B: seen_B = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
A[3] = 4 is in seen_B, so add 4 to common.
B[3] = 4 is in seen_A (already added to common).
common = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Append len(common) = 4 to result: result = [0, 2, 3, 4].
Final Result:
[0, 2, 3, 4]

Example 2: A = [2, 3, 1], B = [3, 1, 2]
Initialization:

seen_A = set()
seen_B = set()
common = set()
result = []
Iteration Steps:

Index i = 0:

Add A[0] = 2 to seen_A: seen_A = {2}.
Add B[0] = 3 to seen_B: seen_B = {3}.
A[0] = 2 is not in seen_B.
B[0] = 3 is not in seen_A.
common = {}.
Append len(common) = 0 to result: result = [0].
Index i = 1:

Add A[1] = 3 to seen_A: seen_A = {2, 3}.
Add B[1] = 1 to seen_B: seen_B = {1, 3}.
A[1] = 3 is in seen_B, so add 3 to common.
B[1] = 1 is not in seen_A.
common = {3}.
Append len(common) = 1 to result: result = [0, 1].
Index i = 2:

Add A[2] = 1 to seen_A: seen_A = {1, 2, 3}.
Add B[2] = 2 to seen_B: seen_B = {1, 2, 3}.
A[2] = 1 is in seen_B, so add 1 to common.
B[2] = 2 is in seen_A, so add 2 to common.
common = {1, 2, 3}.
Append len(common) = 3 to result: result = [0, 1, 3].
Final Result:
[0, 1, 3]

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n)

Iterating through A and B once.
O(1) operations for adding to a set and checking membership.
Space Complexity: O(n)

Space for seen_A, seen_B, and common.
